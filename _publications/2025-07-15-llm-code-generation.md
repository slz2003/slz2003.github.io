This paper addresses the challenge of generating code that is not only functional but also safe and correct. We propose a framework that integrates formal verification techniques with large language models, ensuring that generated code adheres to formal specifications and program semantics.

## Key Contributions

- Novel integration of LLMs with formal verification
- Automated safety checking for generated code
- Experimental evaluation on multiple benchmarks

## Results

Our approach significantly improves the safety and correctness of LLM-generated code while maintaining high functionality.
