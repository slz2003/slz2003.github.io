About Me
======
I'm Lize Shao, and I earned my undergraduate degree from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) in 2025, where I completed a dual major in Mathematics and Computer Science. I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Xia](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html) Hu and [Prof. Tegawendé F. Bissyandé](https://bissyande.github.io/) during my studies.

From 2021 to 2025, I was honored to be a recipient of the Rice Trustee Distinguished Scholarship.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Software Engineering, Formal Methods and Machine Learning.

I am an incoming Ph.D Student at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) stating from 2025 Fall.
